bi-objective-solver
===================

A bunch of bi-objective solvers implemented in Python + Cplex API

Implemented:
- Rectangle Splitting Algorithm (Boland et al. 2013)
- Epsilon Constraint Method
- Bidirectional Epsilon Constraint
- Normal Constraint Method (Messac et al. 2003)
- Hypervolume Indicator (Zitler and Thiele 2003)
- Adjusted Hypervolume Indicator for quality estimate of a pareto front approximation (Boland et al. 2013)
